Dear _name_:<br><br>
As a resident of your district, I am writing to ask you to please immediately end the fall cankerworm insecticide-spraying program, and to re-direct those funds to benefit forest health.<br>
The targeted fall cankerworm is a native moth that has evolved over the millennia along with our trees and is an important part of our urban forest ecosystems.  This caterpillar is commonly called the "inchworm."<br>
<br>
The inchworm is an ideal food source for birds as it lacks spines and chemical defenses, and appears just as birds are migrating through our area and beginning their breeding season.<br>
<br>
The pesticide that is applied is deadly not only to the target native inchworm, but to ALL exposed butterflies and moths that are in their caterpillar stage of life.  One insect likely killed by the pesticide spraying is the spectacular Eastern Tiger Swallowtail, Virginiaâ€™s state insect.  The Audubon Society of Northern Virginia has documented more than 60 species of springtime butterflies near where spraying occurs and that may be killed by the spraying.<br>
<br>
The County does not attempt to measure or understand the benefits to the ecosystem of the fall cankerworm and the other impacted butterflies and moths, nor does the County attempt to measure or understand the extent of the harm caused by the insecticide spraying to our urban forest ecosystems, which include butterflies and birds.<br>
<br>
For these reasons, I am asking that this harmful program be ended as soon as possible and that funds be re-directed to more productively benefit the health of our urban forest ecosystems.<br>
<br>
Sincerely yours,<br>
</p>
